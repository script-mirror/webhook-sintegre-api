*This lessons-learned file serves as a critical knowledge base for capturing and preventing mistakes. During development, document any reusable solutions, bug fixes, or important patterns using the format: [Timestamp] Category: Issue → Solution → Impact. Entries must be categorized by priority (Critical/Important/Enhancement) and include clear problem statements, solutions, prevention steps, and code examples. Only update upon user request with "lesson" trigger word. Focus on high-impact, reusable lessons that improve code quality, prevent common errors, and establish best practices. Cross-reference with @memories.md for context.*

# Lessons Learned

*Note: This file is updated only upon user request and focuses on capturing important, reusable lessons learned during development. Each entry includes a timestamp, category, and comprehensive explanation to prevent similar issues in the future.*

[2024-02-20 10:30] Service Architecture: Issue: Handling unknown webhook payload fields while maintaining type safety → Solution: Used TypeScript intersection types (CreateWebhookSintegreDto & Record<string, any>) to allow extra fields while preserving required field validation → Why: Critical for maintaining API flexibility while ensuring core data structure integrity. Enables future webhook payload expansion without breaking changes.

[2024-02-20 10:31] Error Handling: Issue: Managing multiple async operations (file download, S3 upload) with proper cleanup → Solution: Implemented try-catch blocks with finally clause for temp file cleanup, detailed error logging, and status updates → Why: Ensures system reliability, proper resource cleanup, and maintains data consistency even during failures.

[2024-02-20 10:32] File Processing: Issue: Need for non-blocking webhook processing while handling large files → Solution: Implemented asynchronous file processing after initial webhook receipt, with status tracking and error handling → Why: Improves API responsiveness and user experience while maintaining data integrity and process tracking.
