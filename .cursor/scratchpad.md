_This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (🎯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (⚡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process._

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):

1. Implementation Type (New Features):

   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (🎯) → 95% confidence → Agent mode (⚡)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (🎯) → Chain of thought analysis → Agent mode (⚡)

Cross-reference with @memories.md and @lessons-learned.md for context and best practices.`

# Mode: PLAN 🎯

## Implementation Plan: Sintegre Webhook API 📋

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Structure

1. Initialize NestJS project with TypeScript
2. Configure MongoDB connection
3. Set up AWS S3 integration
4. Create basic project structure:
   ```
   src/
   ├── config/
   ├── modules/
   │   └── webhook/
   ├── shared/
   │   ├── interfaces/
   │   └── utils/
   └── main.ts
   ```

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

1. Create Webhook Module

   - WebhookController
   - WebhookService
   - WebhookSchema
   - DTOs & Interfaces

2. Implement File Processing

   - FileDownloadService
   - S3UploadService
   - Queue system for async processing

3. Create API Endpoints
   - POST /api/webhooks/sintegre
   - GET /api/webhooks
   - GET /api/webhooks/:id
   - GET /api/webhooks/:id/download
   - GET /api/webhooks/metrics

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation

1. Unit Tests
2. Integration Tests
3. API Documentation (Swagger)
4. README and deployment guide

### Confidence Level: 95% ✅

Ready to begin implementation. Shall we start with Phase 1?

## Implementation Progress 🚀

### ✅ Completed

1. Basic Project Structure
2. MongoDB Schema (WebhookSintegre)
3. Shared Services:
   - S3Service for file storage
   - FileDownloadService for handling downloads
   - SharedModule configuration
4. Repository Layer:
   - CRUD operations
   - Metrics aggregation
   - Status tracking
5. Controller Layer:
   - POST /api/webhooks/sintegre
   - GET /api/webhooks (with filters)
   - GET /api/webhooks/:id
   - GET /api/webhooks/:id/download
   - GET /api/webhooks/metrics
   - Swagger documentation
   - Error handling
   - Logging
6. Service Layer:
   - Flexible payload handling
   - Asynchronous file processing
   - S3 integration
   - Status management
   - Error handling and logging
   - Metrics calculation

### 🏗️ Next Steps

1. Add Tests:

   - Unit tests for services
   - Integration tests for endpoints
   - E2E tests for file processing

2. Documentation:
   - API documentation
   - Deployment guide
   - Environment variables setup

### Current Focus: Testing Implementation

- Write comprehensive tests for all components
- Ensure proper error handling coverage
- Test file processing workflow
- Validate metrics calculations

### Confidence Level: 95% ✅

Ready to implement tests. Would you like me to proceed with that next?
