# Webhook Service Implementation

## Overview
Implementation of the WebhookSintegre service layer handling webhook processing, file management, and metrics calculation.

## Key Components

### 1. Flexible Payload Handling
- Uses TypeScript intersection types for extensible payloads
- Preserves required field validation
- Stores additional fields in MongoDB

### 2. File Processing Workflow
- Asynchronous processing after webhook receipt
- Download from source URL
- S3 upload with organized structure
- Temporary file cleanup
- Status tracking throughout process

### 3. Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Detailed error logging
- Status updates for failures
- Resource cleanup in finally blocks

### 4. Integration Points
- MongoDB for webhook storage
- S3 for file storage
- FileDownload service for retrieval
- Status tracking and metrics

## Best Practices
1. Non-blocking operations
2. Resource cleanup
3. Comprehensive logging
4. Type safety
5. Error handling
6. Status management

## Technical Decisions
1. Async file processing for better performance
2. S3 for reliable file storage
3. Flexible payload structure for future expansion
4. Status tracking for process visibility
